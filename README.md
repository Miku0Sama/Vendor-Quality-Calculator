# Vendor Quality Recipe Calculator
Simple Python script to find the optimal combinations of items to get the quality currencies from vendor recipes.

# How to use
First, you'll need a python interpreter. There are many options available ranging from downloaded programs to free online interpreters but I recommend using [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_default) as they also provide indepth explanations of most native python functions.

Once you have an interpreter all you need to do is copy the code in [QualityRecipeCalc.py](QualityRecipeCalc.py) and paste it into the interpreter. Then, at the bottom of the code you'll find where you input the information needed for the script to work. Once you've inputted all the required info, hit run on the interpreter and the script will spit out a list of combinations that will get you those sweet, sweet quality currencies.
